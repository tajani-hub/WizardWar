Hello there!

The name of my Term Project is Wizard War!
It is a turn-based RPG that allows you to pick between
1 of 5 opponents of varying difficulties.

The game is simple! You have a constant set of moves.
The more you play, the more you understand them.

To use a move, or make any decision really, just press
the corresponding number. Be careful, however! An invalid input
will be treated as a wasted turn, so always pay attention.

Starting the game is easy. Simply run the "WizardWar.py"
file in any editor of your choice. No other setup is necessary.

Have Fun!
Thanks for playing Wizard War!

To do/Planned updates:
- Rebalance weapon and spell strengths. As is, AI decides that using a weapon is
always more useful than healing, items or poison.
- Finetune sprite animations to fix back and forth wobbling
- Make drawing functions proportional to screen size to allow resizing windows
